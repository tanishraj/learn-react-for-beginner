import React from "react";

const es6Component = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Functional Component (ES6 Way):</h1>
      <p>
        It is also possible for us to write our functional component in
        completely ES6 ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the simplest way to create a component. Those are pure
        JavaScript functions that accept props object as first parameter and
        return React elements:
      </p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default es6Component;
